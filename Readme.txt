	This is backup copy of the Mace source code project as Google Code was shut down.

	--Please note this hasn't been updated since Sep 5, 2012, so while it works with the current version of Minecraft as         of October 2016, it may not work in the future if the level format is changed or the Java version is ditched in favor         of the Windows 10/C++ version--

        Mace is a tool for creating Minecraft worlds with
          randomly generated cities.

        Have fun :)

    Requirements
    ------------

        Mace requires the Microsoft .NET Framework,
          version 4 or later. You probably have this,
          but if necessary it can be obtained from:
          http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=186913

    Instructions
    ------------

        1. Unzip all the files (Mace.exe, etc) anywhere.
        2. Run Mace.exe and change any options that you'd like.
        3. Click the "Generate World" button.
        4. Open MineCraft and go to the start of your world list.
        5. Play your new world!
