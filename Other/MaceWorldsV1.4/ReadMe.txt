Hi!

This archive contains five worlds created by Mace v1.4.

To play on these worlds, put them into your MineCraft Saves
  folder. You can locate this by going to Start -> Run
  then entering

%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\

Copy the folders into there and then look for the worlds
  at the end of your MineCraft world list.

The cities are:

City of Seven Fall (Very small)

City of Shawneesummer (Small)

City of Lostton (Normal)

City of Obsidian Garden (Large)

City of Big Decagon (Very large)

Have fun :)
