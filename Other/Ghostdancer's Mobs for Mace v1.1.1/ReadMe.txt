Details
=======
You can interact with the friendly mobs by right-clicking on them. Unless otherwise mentioned, they will trade items for gold nuggets.
They will hand out only one item at the time, but will gladly accept additional gold nuggets. So be careful about how many nuggets you have in your item slot, when you right-click on them.

The following mobs will be added:

Poor Man - neutral mob
Drops wheat and sells melon seeds.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GPoor".

Rich Man - neutral mob
Drops gold nuggets and wanders around looking at his watch. Time is Yuan!
He will pay you in gold nuggets for paintings.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GRich".

Maid - neutral mob
Drops wheat.
If you give her a flower, she will share a cookie with you.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GMaid".

Sage - neutral mob
Wise man of the east. Carries a scroll and drops paper.
Because it is dangerous to go alone, he will sell you maps.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GSage".

Knight - neutral mob
Drops apples and wanders around. You know, just like real knights!
Will defend other NPCs if they are attacked.
Sells nothing, but a right-click may be otherwise rewarding.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GKnight".

Smith - neutral mob
Drops coal and sells various (random) iron equipment.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GSmith".

Rogue - aggressive mob
Drops arrows and can also shoot them quite aptly.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GRogue".

Cultist - aggressive mob
Venerates the creeper that shall not be named and casts cold spells.
Not very effective, but what is there to expect from crazed cultists?
Spawns during night and underground, but won't be set on fire by the sun. A shame.
He will drop nether warts. Yuck. Don't ask.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GCultist".

Geist - aggressive mob
Drops slimeballs and floats around, but can't fly.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GGeist".

Grim Creeper - aggressive mob
Evil spirt of death. Drops bones and haunts cities.
Killing it will open a rift to the underworld and spawn geists.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GGrim".

Grubman - aggressive mob
Goblinoid earthdwellers who collect silverfish and other creepy crawlies.
Drops mycelium. Very territorial.
The EntityID for MobSpawners is "GGrubman".


As all mobs come with MobSpawner EntityIDs, you can use them with MobSpawners in the resource world.

The uncompiled source files are included, in case you want to take a look at how the mod was done.

You can change the spawn rates of the mobs by editing the "GeistersMobs.properties" file, which will be created in your Minecraft directory.
